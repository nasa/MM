 *  \par Command Structure

 *
 *  \par Command Verification
 *       Successful execution of this command may be verified with
 *       the following telemetry:
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.CmdCounter will increment
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.LastAction will be set to #MM_FILL
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.MemType will be set to the commanded memory type
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.Address will be set to the fully resolved destination memory address
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.DataValue will be set to the fill pattern used
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.BytesProcessed will be set to the number of bytes filled
 *       - The #MM_FILL_INF_EID informational event message will
 *         be generated when the command is executed
 *
 *  \par Error Conditions
 *       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
 *       - Command packet length not as expected
 *       - A symbol name was specified that can't be resolved
 *       - The address range fails validation check
 *       - The specified data size is invalid
 *       - The address and data size are not properly aligned
 *       - The specified memory type is invalid
 *
 *  \par Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
 *       - #MM_HkPacket_Payload_t.ErrCounter will increment
 *       - Error specific event message #MM_LEN_ERR_EID
 *       - Error specific event message #MM_SYMNAME_ERR_EID

 *       - Error specific event message #MM_ALIGN16_ERR_EID
 *       - Error specific event message #MM_MEMTYPE_ERR_EID
 *
 *  \par Criticality
 *       It is the responsibility of the user to verify the <i>DestSymAddress</i>,
 *       and <i>NumOfBytes</i> in the command.  It is highly recommended to verify
 *       the success or failure of the memory fill.  The fill may be verified by
 *       dumping memory and evaluating the dump contents.  It is possible to destroy
 *       critical information with this command causing unknown consequences.  In
 *       addition, it is possible to generate a machine check exception when accessing
 *       I/O memory addresses/registers and other types of memory. The user
 *       is cautioned to use extreme care.
 *
 *       Note: Valid memory ranges are defined within a hardcoded structure contained in the
 *       PSP layer (CFE_PSP_MemoryTable) however, not every address within the defined ranges
